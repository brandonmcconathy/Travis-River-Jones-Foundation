        <p className="px-6 pb-5 text-justify">In honor of our beloved son and brother, Travis River Jones, we established this foundation. Travis graduated from San Dimas High School in 2022, where he actively participated in cross country, track, wrestling, and even the mascot team. His enthusiasm for school life and cherished moments with friends were palpable. Post-graduation, Travis pursued EMT training, ultimately juggling full-time work with a local 911 ambulance provider alongside his studies at Chaffey College. His dream was to become a paramedic firefighter, but tragically, on February 25th, 2023, he lost his life in a car accident caused by a reckless driver while waiting at a traffic light. In the wake of his untimely passing, an outpouring of stories from friends and educators highlighted his extraordinary kindness, inspiring the birth of this foundation and the subsequent creation of the Kindness Scholarships and EMT Scholarships we now proudly bestow. Since its inception in 2023, our foundation has passionately committed over $10,500 to these scholarships, with Travis's family covering all fees and administrative costs. Rest assured, every dollar raised directly fuels these scholarships, and we hold 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, making your generous donations fully tax-deductible.</p>
